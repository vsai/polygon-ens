# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

Can see the NFT on the mumbai testnet: https://testnet.rarible.com/collection/polygon/0x77ee47f54805f35f016502c3cca27f686b8903a7/items
